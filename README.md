# Solid-works-CAD
Overview

This project involves creating a detailed engineering drawing and 3D model using SolidWorks CAD software. The goal is to design a mechanical part or assembly, ensuring the final drawings meet standard engineering conventions for manufacturing and technical communication.

Project Objectives

Develop a 3D model of a mechanical part or assembly in SolidWorks.

Create a fully detailed 2D engineering drawing, including dimensions, annotations, and title blocks.

Apply proper geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) techniques.

Ensure the drawing adheres to engineering standards (ISO/ANSI).

Software and Tools Used

SolidWorks: For 3D modeling and 2D drawing generation.

GitHub: To manage version control and track project progress.

Features

3D Model: Includes accurate geometry, material properties, and mass analysis.

Engineering Drawing: Contains orthographic projections, isometric views, detailed section views, and annotations.
